- 👋 Hi, I’m @kidscoots101
- 👀 I’m interested in coding in react-native and creating apps that impact the community.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about all the libraries in react-native and how I can apply them in my code/app.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an app together and find a client for my current business.
- 📫 How to reach me you can reach me by my work email growcalth.main@gmail.com or DM us on instagram @GrowCalth We are not that big yet that explains the lack of followers :)
