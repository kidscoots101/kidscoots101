# Hey! I'm Caleb!

Currently a Secondary School student and an avid software developer.

I'm an eager start-up enthusiast, and aim to turn ideas into reality. I'm also a goal-driven individual, who plans to launch my own start-up in the near future. Innovation and creativity fuel my passion for start-ups.

I've done many tech-related projects; and am willing to work on more! These projects include AttendINC, an efficient attendance taking system and GrowCalth, a one-stop platform for students to partcipate actively in their houses. These are just a few; and you can view more at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caleb-han-792349235/) profile.
