# Hey! I'm Caleb!

Currently a student at the [School of Science and Technology, Singapore](https://sst.edu.sg/) and an avid software developer.

I'm an eager start-up enthusiast, and aim to turn ideas into reality. I'm also a goal-driven individual, who plans to launch my own start-up in the near future. Innovation and creativity fuel my passion for start-ups.

I've done many tech-related projects; and am willing to work on more! These projects include [AttendINC](https://attend-inc-sandy.vercel.app/), an efficient attendance taking system and [GrowCalth](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/growcalth/id6456388202), a one-stop platform for students to partcipate actively in their houses. These are just a few; and you can view more at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caleb-han-792349235/) profile.
